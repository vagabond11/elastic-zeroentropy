**Title**: "Show HN: I built an Elasticsearch reranker powered by ZeroEntropy - boost search relevance by 28%"

**Post Content**:
```
Hey HN! I've been working on a Python library that integrates Elasticsearch with ZeroEntropy's state-of-the-art reranking models to create intelligent search engines.

**What it does:**
- Takes your existing Elasticsearch setup
- Adds ZeroEntropy's LLM-powered reranking on top
- Boosts search relevance by up to 28% NDCG@10
- Works with just a few lines of code

**Key features:**
- Async/await support for high performance
- Comprehensive error handling and retries
- CLI for testing and debugging
- Full type safety with Pydantic
- Production-ready with 95%+ test coverage

**Quick example:**
```python
import asyncio
from elastic_zeroentropy import ElasticZeroEntropyReranker

async def search():
    async with ElasticZeroEntropyReranker() as reranker:
        response = await reranker.search(
            query="machine learning applications",
            index="my_documents"
        )
        for result in response.results:
            print(f"Score: {result.score:.4f} - {result.document.title}")

asyncio.run(search())
```

**Why I built this:**
I was frustrated with the complexity of setting up intelligent search. Most solutions require extensive ML infrastructure, but ZeroEntropy's API makes it simple. This library bridges the gap between Elasticsearch's powerful indexing and ZeroEntropy's intelligent reranking.

**Tech stack:**
- Python 3.8+
- Elasticsearch 8+
- ZeroEntropy API
- httpx for async HTTP
- Pydantic for data validation

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install elastic-zeroentropy
```

**GitHub:** https://github.com/houssamouaziz/elastic-zeroentropy-reranker

**Documentation:** https://github.com/houssamouaziz/elastic-zeroentropy-reranker#readme

I'd love feedback on the API design, documentation, and any features you'd like to see. Also happy to help anyone integrate this into their existing search infrastructure!

**Questions for the community:**
- What search use cases are you most interested in?
- Any specific Elasticsearch features you'd like better integration with?
- Thoughts on the API design and ergonomics?

## Email Pitch to ZeroEntropy Founders

**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity: Python Library Integration for ZeroEntropy

**Body**:
```
Hi [Founder Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I'm reaching out because I've built a Python library that integrates ZeroEntropy's reranking API with Elasticsearch, and I believe there's a great opportunity for collaboration.

**What I've built:**
- `elastic-zeroentropy`: A production-ready Python library that seamlessly integrates ZeroEntropy's reranking with Elasticsearch
- Comprehensive async support, error handling, and CLI tools
- 95%+ test coverage and full type safety
- Ready for PyPI publication

**Why this matters:**
- Makes ZeroEntropy accessible to the massive Elasticsearch ecosystem
- Reduces integration complexity for developers
- Provides a clear path from basic search to intelligent search
- Could significantly increase ZeroEntropy API adoption

**Proposed collaboration:**
1. **Official endorsement**: ZeroEntropy could officially endorse/recommend this library
2. **Documentation integration**: Link to this library from ZeroEntropy docs
3. **Co-marketing**: Joint blog post or webinar about intelligent search
4. **Technical collaboration**: Work together on API improvements or new features

**Benefits for ZeroEntropy:**
- Increased developer adoption
- Reduced support burden (library handles common integration issues)
- Stronger positioning in the search ecosystem
- Community-driven development and feedback

**Next steps:**
- I'm planning to publish to PyPI this week
- Would love to discuss how we could work together
- Happy to share the codebase for review

Would you be interested in a quick call to discuss this opportunity? I'm excited about the potential for this integration to help more developers adopt intelligent search.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
